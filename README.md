A small quiz game based on HTML5's Drag and Drop effect which was meant as a tutorial project.

This project was started by Herbert Braun and featured in c't Magazin 4/2007. More information: www.woerter.de/textverzeichnis/#filter/id=40 (in German).

Comments and variable names are in German. I'll gladly translate them if there is demand.
